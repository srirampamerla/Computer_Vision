color thrsholding is a technique to filter out a specific rnage of colors in an image by defining upper nad lower bounds in color space. 
We use it to segment,replace or isolate specific colors in an image.

Targetting. In terns of hsc i am picking some particular red. if i change the brightness of the particular color. in HSV it will chnage only V
so we can seperate from brightness.
HSV is used for better color Targetting
RGB-> it will impact on three colors
V-> Vertical part and S-horozontal part inveted cone(H has 0 to 360)

    Actual      Open CV 8%denote inters of colore
H--0-360  -     0-179
S--0-100%-      0-255
V-- 0 -100%     0-255

RGB - # channels RGBHSV
Hue we need to change to convert into mask

if we need to traget green we need upper bond and lowerbound
upper bound -121 degree lower 119degree between this we cna use

Hue has {[[20,55,80],[5,100,178],[104,52,60],[10,166,10]]}  form the image. if any one value is matched in the range{119-121} we will
keep it 1 else zero

it will be one channels. we will see balck and white (that will be binary values)

I want to pink color (By default open cv it has BGR). we will convert into HSV because at the end we want tot target interns of HSV
if the mask greater than zero we will chnage if it zero we wcann keep it as it is.
if the mask has one  we will change to pink colorwhevwer it s black we will keep it as same

0_black and 1-white 0_> Orginal image and 1 -> Masked image
